"""GDPR account management — 30-day grace-period deletion + public deletion request.

Store compliance (Apple 5.1.1(v) + Google Play Data deletion): logged-in users can
request account deletion in-app; a public page/endpoint lets anyone start the process.
Deletion deactivates the account immediately and permanently purges it (plus personal
data) after a 30-day grace window. Anonymized payment/order records are retained for
legal/tax purposes only.
